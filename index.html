    <h2>Hey, You Wanna Join Our Visual Novel A Game Project in Progress?</h2>

    <p>Hey there! I’m Travis K. Nagel, the lead manager, scriptwriter, and programmer for an exciting visual novel project currently in development. Our dedicated team is working hard to bring this game to life, featuring people from a talented band, a game tester, and a character artist. We’re aiming to launch the game on Steam by fall 2025!</p>

    <p>We’re on the lookout for a skilled digital background designer who’s familiar with visual novels. If you have a portfolio showcasing your work, we’d love to see it! To give you an idea of the process we’re looking for, it’s similar to what’s outlined in this tutorial: <a href="http://www.mclelun.com/2015/10/anime-background-tutorial.html" target="_blank" style="color: #494bcc;">Anime Background Tutorial</a>. Even if you don’t have much experience with visual novel backgrounds but have completed work in architecture or general background design, that’s perfectly fine. We’d much rather see polished work outside our niche than incomplete projects that closely match our vision.</p>

    <p>This is mostly a volunteer position, perfect if you’re looking to gain real-world experience with a passionate and supportive team. While I’d love to offer payment, we’re currently working with a tight budget that is funded entirely out of pocket. That said, we can discuss payment possibilities, but please know it won’t be anything extravagant.</p>

    <p>We meet bi-weekly online, and we’re super flexible with deadlines. We understand the importance of balancing work, school, and life, and we’re happy to accommodate your schedule.</p>

    <p>If this sounds like something you’d love to be part of, hit me up on Instagram or email me. We’d be thrilled to hear from you!</p>

            <!-- About Me Section -->
<section id="about-me" class="about-section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I’m Mr. Blue, and here’s a little about me. I was born and raised in Texas, and growing up, I moved around a lot from school to school. But through all that change, video games and tabletop games have always been my constant source of fun and joy.</p>
    <p>As a gamer, I’ve explored everything from Nintendo to Xbox, PlayStation to PC. I’ve got more games than I could count. I’ve spent years diving into countless worlds and stories, and video games have always been there for me, through both the highs and the lows. They’ve taught me problem-solving, strategy, and the simple reminder to kick back and breathe every once in a while. I wouldn’t trade those experiences for anything.</p>
    <p>Now, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have concerns about the future of gaming. A lot of AAA companies these days are all about profits rather than player enjoyment. Many of the folks running these companies are more businessmen than gamers, focusing on microtransactions, battle passes, and pre-order DLCs which, if you ask me, feels like selling an incomplete game.</p>
    <p>I’m no business guru, just a simple gamer in my twenties, and I want to create games that bring back that joy and nostalgia I’ve experienced over the years so that someone else can experience those same feelings.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s narrative-driven adventures, strategic card games, or MMORPGs that aren’t pay-to-win, I’m all about games that prioritize fun and player enjoyment. I may be starting small with a visual novel and maybe that isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but you have to start small to go somewhere big.</p>
    <p>One thing’s for sure, Divinity Games is founded <b><i>By Gamers, For Gamers</i></b>. That’s what we’re all about. Games have always been there for me, and I want to create something that’ll do the same for others. That’s what drives me.</p>

        <!-- Visual Novel About Section -->
        <section id="games" class="about-section">
            <h2>What's Our Current Project About?</h2>
<p>It’s a visual novel where you play as a college student who’s hit rock bottom and is slowly rediscovering his purpose. This romance-comedy might just include an 18+ patch for those looking for a little extra spice.</p>
<p>You start off flying under the radar but soon get roped into a struggling board games club filled with a colorful cast of characters. There’s Emi, the seemingly perfect club president with hidden layers, Aiko, your sporty and teasing childhood friend, Yui, a teacher who’s secretly a gaming nerd, Mika, a rich idol with her own reasons for joining, and Ken, your laid-back, ever-supportive best friend.</p>
<p>Expect quirky moments, fierce rivalries like the Wenga League, and all the ups and downs of college romance. With laughs, surprises, and the chance for something deeper, every choice pulls you further into a story packed with humor, drama, and dare I say the thrill of building relationships.</p>
