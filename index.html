    <h2>Yo, You Wanna Join Our Visual Novel, A Game Project In Progress?</h2>
    <p>Hey, what’s up! I’m Travis K. Nagel, I’m the lead manager, scriptwriter, and programmer for a super cool visual novel game in the making. Got a sweet band and a game tester already on board, and we’re aiming to launch this project on Steam by fall 2025, hopefully around August.</p>
    
    <p>We’re looking for someone skilled in digital character designs and digital background designs who knows their way around visual novels. If you’ve got a portfolio to show off, we’d love to check it out!</p>
    
    <p>Now, I won’t sugarcoat it, this is a volunteer gig for the most part, perfect if you’re looking to get some real experience with a passionate team. I’d love to pay you, but we’re working with tight pockets here all funds so far have been out-of-pocket. We can chat about payment possibilities, but just know, it won’t be anything wild.</p>
    
    <p>If you're only skilled in one area, either backgrounds or character design, no worries, we can still talk!</p>
    
    <p>If you’re down, hit me up on Instagram or my email!</p>

            <!-- About Me Section -->
<section id="about-me" class="about-section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I’m Mr. Blue, and here’s a little about me. I was born and raised in Texas, and growing up, I moved around a lot from school to school. But through all that change, video games and tabletop games have always been my constant source of fun and joy.</p>
    <p>As a gamer, I’ve explored everything from Nintendo to Xbox, PlayStation to PC. I’ve got more games than I could count. I’ve spent years diving into countless worlds and stories, and video games have always been there for me, through both the highs and the lows. They’ve taught me problem-solving, strategy, and the simple reminder to kick back and breathe every once in a while. I wouldn’t trade those experiences for anything.</p>
    <p>Now, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have concerns about the future of gaming. A lot of AAA companies these days are all about profits rather than player enjoyment. Many of the folks running these companies are more businessmen than gamers, focusing on microtransactions, battle passes, and pre-order DLCs which, if you ask me, feels like selling an incomplete game.</p>
    <p>I’m no business guru, just a simple gamer in my twenties, and I want to create games that bring back that joy and nostalgia I’ve experienced over the years so that someone else can experience those same feelings.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s narrative-driven adventures, strategic card games, or MMORPGs that aren’t pay-to-win, I’m all about games that prioritize fun and player enjoyment. I may be starting small with a visual novel and maybe that isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but you have to start small to go somewhere big.</p>
    <p>One thing’s for sure, Divinity Games is founded by <b><i>Gamers, for Gamers</i></b>. That’s what we’re all about. Games have always been there for me, and I want to create something that’ll do the same for others. That’s what drives me.</p>
